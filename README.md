# bayesian-data-analysis-mcmc
This repository features two Jupyter Notebooks detailing implementations of
Bayesian data analysis in Python both with and without MCMC.

In each notebook we consider two problems: finding the most likely probability
of heads based on numerous coin flips and calculating the likely position of
a lighthouse based on the photon positions measured along the coast.
